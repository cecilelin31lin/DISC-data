Dominance – These people are driven, determined and can tend to be a bit overbearing at times. (I am a “D”, I know that which I speak of!)
So if you are selling to a D, you better get to the point fast. Bullet points and headlines make content easier to read and digest. We like to control our consumption so you may be able to use the phone but don't start with, “what are you doing or how is your day going”. Niceties are lost on D's, we just want to get on the phone, find out what is needed or what you are selling and get off.
If you are sending a marketing message out to D's, use bold statements. My marketing to D's includes, “not a sing kumbaya, hand holding coaching program, I assume you will do what you commit to without me having to check with you every day”. Now that sounds harsh if you are another personality type, but for a D (who I like to work with), it is so much better than some kind of boilerplate marketing drivel. Remember, fast and to the point.
D's make buying decisions fast. Rarely will we ponder for days, let alone weeks, on whether or not to buy something. We are jump right in and get started kinds of kids. That being said, don't forget, we can dump you just as fast so you might want to spread your marketing around a bit!
