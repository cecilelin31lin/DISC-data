People with a high D personality type like to be in positions of authority or do things on their terms. These people tend to be risk-takers and self-starters, as well as extraordinarily goal-oriented and competitive. Furthermore, D style personalities are excellent problem-solvers, big-picture thinkers and tend to respond well to logic, reason, and information (but not emotion). The D style has high ego strength, which could be perceived positively as confidence or negatively as pride.

What Motivates D Personalities?
Type D personality styles are highly motivated by new challenges, setting and achieving goals, and seeing tangible results. They appreciate receiving verbal recognition from others as well as rewards. They enjoy the power and authority to take risks and make decisions. Freedom from routine and mundane tasks is essential. Since repetition is frustrating for the D, changing environments between work and play can be highly motivating.
How to Work With D Personalities
When working with a D style, be direct, to the point, and brief. Concentrate on tangible facts and talk about “what” instead of “how.” Emphasize business topics instead of social issues and try to be results-oriented. Make suggestions for how to achieve the goal instead of talking about why it won’t work. Try to think like a D and adapt to their personality traits when interacting with them. Be confident and focus on problem-solving.
Personal Growth Areas
They may be perceived as always speaking and not listening to others. The D may need to strive to listen more actively, be attentive to other team members’ ideas and strive for consensus instead of making decisions alone. Instead of making only broad, decisive statements, be careful to explain the “whys” of your proposals and decisions. The D can be controlling and domineering and will need to watch their tone and body language when feeling frustrated or stressed out. The D can be all business and goals, making them seem socially inhibited. They may need to center more on developing personal relationships and recognizing others’ opinions, feelings, and desires. It may take some intentionality to be friendlier and more approachable in social interactions.
