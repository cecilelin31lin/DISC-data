High I personality
Evaluation: Tina is well aware Ivan has an abundance of curiosity, listening, imagination, and creativity. But he is less reliant on critical thinking and accuracy. Ivan's continuously active imagination and brainstorming are strengths that become a limitation as he has difficulty settling on a single course of action.
Action: Tina worked with Ivan to understand how his behavior influenced other team members and adjacent departments. People respect and appreciate his imagination and creativity, and willingness to adapt to new ideas. The problem is the constant shifting between approaches, which has been problematic to the team and organization.
Result: The changes Ivan made were implementing his ideas with the team and getting to a joint outcome by a specific time. He created a mantra for himself he uses when he is still ideating, "On time and in scope, is better than a missed deadline and the potential for a marginally better result."
