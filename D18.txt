Dominance
This area represents those who are confident and results-driven. People who fall in this category tend to be competitive and can work well under pressure. They can also come across as impatient or demanding at times.

Someone who demonstrates a strong tendency towards the D style prioritises action and results. This is often seen as the typical C-suite authoritative personality type. They are keen to be challenged and are often assertive - sometimes to the point of being forceful. If you have a dominant personality type, you may need to work on your patience or empathy to balance your strong-willed personality in certain situations.
