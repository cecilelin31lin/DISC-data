C – Compliance

Those with a high Compliance (C) style are the most analytical of all the groups. C’s are analytical and gravitate towards process, structure, and rules. C’s can be sceptical and use logic to make decisions, rather than being swayed by emotions. Their strengths are likely to lie in their ability to think through their choices. Their ability to think deeply about issues can make them excellent problem-solvers.
