A bright example of a D-type personality is Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States. If Trump wasn’t D, he wouldn’t become such a brilliant businessman in the first place and he wouldn’t be elected as a president. He was programmed to become who he has become from his very birthday when his DiSC type was defined. People with a high D behavioral type are described as dominant, decisive, doer, assertive, competitive, direct, decisive, challenging, pioneering.
