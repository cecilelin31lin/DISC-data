C Strengths:
People who are high C love details. They live for them! They believe directions and rules are made to be followed. And they’re excellent at analytical thinking, research and processes.

C Weaknesses:
People who are high C can seem rigid and inflexible at first. That’s because they want all the facts before they’ll buy in to something new and unknown. They may lack patience for dreamer types who are eager to jump in without as much context.

C’s and Money:
High C’s don’t miss a beat when it comes to budgeting. They know exactly what’s what. They can, however, get too focused on penny-pinching and get frustrated if anyone goes over budget—even by a few dollars. They don’t like losing control, and they can forget the fun aspects of spending money as well.
