“Compliant”(C) Accurate, precise, detailed-oriented. They value quality and accuracy and are afraid of making the wrong decision.

Style people are very accurate, precise, and detail-oriented. They’re naturally cautious and rely on calculated data-backed decisions rather than gut feelings.

High “C” people usually appreciate information with direct, detailed questions. They’re usually bounded by procedures and methods and not verbalize with feelings.

People with high “C” personalities like having as much information as possible. They’re one of the passive styles so give them all the information from your verbal pitch again in writing. Knowing they can review all the documents later and make an informed decision puts “C” people at ease. Having a detailed pros and cons list in your proposal can also help them make a decision. Compliant people are very afraid of making the wrong decision, so offering some type of guarantee or refund can help ease their worry.
