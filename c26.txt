Conclusion
This article is intended as a general introduction to the personality types identified by DiSC profiling, and how this knowledge is used in business. As we have seen every person is a unique blend of 4 personality traits that defines how they approach and deal with tasks and stress, as well as interact with other colleagues.

APeopleBusiness’s StressFactor™ solution incorporates our propriety DiSC profiling technology to help organisations understand the personality mix in their organisation. These insights are especially important in the difficult times created by the Covid-19 pandemic, and the resultant stress on employees forced to work from home.

At the time of writing, a year and a half into the pandemic, we are all too familiar with the very real sense of isolation caused by lockdown, the fear of the unknown, and having to work from a location often unsuited for work. These stresses can be identified by the leadership team, allowing them to take a more caring, sympathetic and personalised approach to dealing with their workforce.
