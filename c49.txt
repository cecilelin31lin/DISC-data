Evaluation: Tina values Chris's need for accuracy and precision, but these same attributes cause Chris to sticks to her guns when people do not follow the rules as she understands them. Chris's rules sometimes seem arbitrary and unyielding, and she could team better by listening more to other's points of view.

Action: Tina lets Chris know the team is moving quickly and changing its approach, so itâ€™s ok to act even if there is no perfect answer. To move forward as fast as possible, sharing her first guesses with the team is encouraged.

Result: Chris was doubtful at first. She sent out ideas for the new agile team she thought premature and ridiculous. Chris was a bit surprised when the team gravitated towards them and moved forward with her guidance. While she believes it might have been a fluke, she is looking forward to spending less time to get things going, as long as there is a quality result at the end.
