The Dominant/Decisive Investor
I have decisive clients who are making investment decisions quickly! They want to get everything done at once. I have to take a moment and remind them that investing — especially in a 401k or similar vehicle — is a slow and steady process.  I remind them also that wealth management issues such as estate planning takes time and like investments, is always evolving. I also see in flashing red letters “DECISIVE” when planning with someone who says they may never retire. That’s perfectly okay, for someone to be so passionate about their career that they never want to quit! But everyone needs to develop a plan “B.”
