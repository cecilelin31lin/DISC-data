Supportive

The third quadrant began with the letter “S” and stands for “supportive” and represents those who have supportive and steady behaviors and also have reserved and people-oriented traits. If you fall into the supportive behavioral style, the tendency is that you are always poised at making and maintaining peace and harmony and also preserving relationships. When you serve as a leader, your leadership style will mostly be characterized by inclusiveness, humility, and affirmation.
