Individuals who sit within the high compliance (C) category are considered to be the most
analytical and reserved compared to other styles.
They are conscientious when dealing with tasks and are often perfectionists.

They will always prioritise understanding the details and facts of a task and use their skills and knowledge to deliver
high-quality output. Those with the C style are naturally risk-averse.
They are driven by facts and logic, so they will need a full understanding before acting to ensure they get the very
best outcome in every situation. Accuracy and getting things right is the key driver for this style.


Accuracy and quality
Analytical and logical focus
The C style is known for being highly accurate and knowledge-focused, which means that getting things right and
doing a quality job can be more important to them than delivering on time.
The C style does have a tendency to overanalyse on occasion and therefore can cause frustration to colleagues with
a lesser interest in detail, especially when there is a need to reach a conclusion. Also, as a result of their constant
quest for accuracy and perfection, they tend to be much more directly critical than those with the other styles.

timescales and what support they can call on. You should approach them in an unemotional and reserved way, being prepared to
answer all the questions they may have to ensure their concurrence and understanding
