D (Decisive)
D Strengths:
People who are high D are great at making decisions. They can cut through the clutter and dive into new and exciting challenges without hesitation. They’re hard-charging, focused on getting the work done, and great at solving problems.
D Weaknesses:
While high D’s are masters of charging ahead, they can run over people in the process—accidentally of course. And they can hurt feelings with their often blunt, direct manner. When it comes to details, D’s tend to overlook the small things in favor of the big picture and getting the job done.
D’s and Money:
High D’s are confident when it comes to making big money decisions. They’re ready to pounce if they see a great deal—even when others get stuck in the details. During budget conversations, however, D’s can dominate instead of making it a team effort. They can also gravitate toward risky investments and impulse purchases.
