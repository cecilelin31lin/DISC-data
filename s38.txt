Submission â€“ These are the nice people who nurture and support.

I like steady instead of submissive. S's are the people who everyone counts on to get things done. If you are selling to an S, you need to make it sound safe and secure with guarantees and lots of testimonials from happy customers. They will read your marketing message and will probably have questions about your products. When prospecting S's, you can call them, making sure to ask how their day is going and about their business or family.

When sending your marketing messages, make sure to have trust symbols like the Visa and Mastercard logos, the Better Business Bureau logo, license numbers (if applicable), etc. You want to talk about having been in business for X-number of years and about how you are going to be around for the long haul. S's like to make sure everything will stay on an even keel.

S's make buying decisions slowly and will stay with you forever as long as you don't rock the boat too much. You can make changes, just make sure to give them notice and time to assimilate them!
