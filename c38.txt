Oh the C's. I think of the C's like CPA, details, details, details! They want to know every bit of your sales process, work flow and reporting deliverables. They will need A LOT of data to make a decision and will need a number of phone calls to close the sale.

When sending your marketing message, no stone should be left unturned. They WILL read them all, highlighting points that they need to clarify before buying. C's also like trust symbols and to know the background of any company they work with. Include degrees earned, certificates achieved, awards won, etc.C's make slow buying decisions and need to nurtured into buying so make sure that you send them a series of direct mail pieces or emails. The first one could be an overview of your products or services and the subsequent ones could be more details about different aspects.

Compliance â€“ Like CPAs and Accountants, these guys need lots of details to be able to function. They like order and structure.
