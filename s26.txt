S - Not a natural manager
Works mostly through being reasonable and relies on consensus and othersâ€™ respect for fair-play. Mild mannered and finds giving discipline difficult. Likely to be rather slow to chide. Will prefer boss to deal with sackings when the subject is unlikely to have had any indications of impending dismissal. Very approachable and can be confided in. Tends to lead by providing a consistent example for subordinates to follow. Usually applies directives rather than initiates changes.
