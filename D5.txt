D: Dominance
Employees who rank exclusively in the dominance (D) area are focused and inspirational as well as strong-willed, self-reliant and independent. They are self-starters who enjoy taking risks. D personalities tend to look at the “big picture,” identify the next best steps in a process and delegate day-to-day tasks.
D types are task-oriented and prefer a faster-paced work environment. However, they may struggle with teamwork, details, and planning. Their forceful and impatient predispositions may be intimidating, especially since they sometimes forget to include others in the problem-solving process.
