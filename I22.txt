I (Interactive)
I Strengths
People with a high I ranking tend to be people-oriented, fun-loving and outgoing. They’re the life of the party and always ready for an adventure. And they can also be extremely persuasive and expressive when sharing ideas.
I Weaknesses:
High I’s may become overly concerned with people-pleasing. They can get caught up in performance and how others perceive them. They can also lose focus on the task at hand, and gravitate toward what’s new and next if things get boring.
I’s and Money:
Where money is involved, I’s tend to be charitable and generous—treating friends and family to dinner or throwing expensive parties for loved ones! They also, however, tend to forget about long-term money goals in favor of immediate wins (or whims). Creating a budget can feel restricting to a high I, rather than freeing (even though it gives them permission to spend within reason!).
