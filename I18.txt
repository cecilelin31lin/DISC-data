Influence
This part embodies an open and sociable attitude. Those who fall under this trait are often talkative and people-focused. They shy away from conflict and can be described as over-emotional.

An individual who demonstrates an Influence-related personality is naturally friendly and optimistic. They tend to prioritise collaboration and show enthusiasm and warmth towards others. Although a highly engaged team player, their overly subjective nature can be problematic. However, by working on being more objective and less emotional towards certain situations, this can be amended.
