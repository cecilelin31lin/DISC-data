**Inducement** – These are the fun people who like to be around other people.

If you are selling to an I, you need to make is sound like you are in it together. I's are much like D's in not wanting to have too much to read and going into overload if you have a four page marketing proposal. They will not want to hurt your feelings and will promise to look at it, but will probably find someone else that makes working with them easier. You can ABSOLUTELY call an I and ask them about their day. They will love it and want to find out about yours too!

If you are sending a marketing message to I's, make sure there are a lot of people in there, and they better look like they are having fun! Talk about working together, being a team and you better have a bunch of contact points. I's will not go off and work by themselves for days, they need to be with people and like to do things together.

I's make buying decisions based on the person they are working with. They will not be swayed by some slick talking D coming along behind you. If they like you they want to work with you, the end. Keep up that relationship with good communication and you will have them for life.
