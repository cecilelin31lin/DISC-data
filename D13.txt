Overview of the Dominant (D) Personality Style
People who are high in “D” are extroverted and outgoing and task-oriented. They tend to be direct, decisive, driven and demanding. They typically have high confidence, are self-motivated, and are comfortable taking risks. They like to focus on the big picture, not details. People who have high “D” are frequently found in leadership positions.
What is the Shadow Side of High D?
When the Dominant trait is overdeveloped, or when people high in D become stressed, they can become impatient, blunt to the point of being insensitive, may force decisions or take actions without first forming a consensus, and use their authority instead of persuasion to get what they want.   
How to Manage Someone with High D
This personality type is typically motivated by new challenges, specific goals, and recognition for achieving goals. Keep these tips in mind:
	•	Communicate briefly and directly (i.e., get to the point)
	•	Provide a lot of autonomy; avoid micromanaging
	•	Agree on clear and measurable goals
	•	Use competition or comparison with others to motivate
