This final variation combines the reliability of S-type personas with the consistency and control of the Conscientiousness category. Those defined with SC personalities are diplomatic and humble people who are focused on steady goals. While this cautious manner can be advantageous, at times, SC individuals could benefit from being more spontaneous.

As a C personality type, you are driven by high standards: accuracy and precision are of the utmost importance. You may be more reserved, and your decision-making process is based on data and facts. This makes C profiles analytical and efficient at finding errors. However, this can also stop you from taking any risks and delay your decision-making process. To balance out your overly sceptical and fact-driven approach, try working with people who have a simpler attitude towards problem-solving. 

Those with a CS personality type are often cautious and reliable individuals whilst also seeking precision and practicality in their work and life. CS personalities tend to overanalyse situations and overcomplicate solutions to simpler problems. This can sometimes be counterproductive if the situation calls for a decisive or urgent response.

The last personality type variation is known as CD - a cross between the Conscientiousness and Dominance traits. Those who fall under this category are disciplined, critical thinkers who strive for efficiency. Although their ability to uphold strict standards can be beneficial in many ways, they can also come across as stubborn and critical. This can be altered by engaging in more collaborative environments and upholding other peoplesâ€™ strengths.
