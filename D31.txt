Knowing one’s own DiSC style, or that of another, can help you be aware of what situations might cause you stress and how you might respond.

You might notice the D style trying to work harder or put in more hours to try and prove themselves. Or they might be focusing on all those areas where they don’t have control and freaking out a bit. Their mental strain might be showing itself through impatience and insensitivity.

**What might be stressing the D style right now?**

- lack of control over a situation
- appearance of being unprofessional or weak
- the possibility of being taken advantage of
- not getting definitive answers
- revisiting topics like schedules, COVID-19 responses, weather changes, politics
- interruptions
- lack of independence or being able to take action
- falling into a boring, unchallenging routine
- dealing with the emotions of others
- anything that challenging their core belief of “I’m valuable if I’m producing or on top.”

**What does the D style need during times of change?**

Progress: being able to get results quickly and efficiently

Control: having influence over decisions that affect them and their success

Justification: knowing how and why changes were made

**Tips for the D style**

- Remember that no one has the control they once did. The pandemic, return to workplaces, and even vaccination protocols are disruptive. So take a deep breath and let get go of self-judgment. Practice self-acceptance.
- Identify what you need to and ultimately can control, then let go of what you can’t. Focus your energies where you can have the most positive impact today or this week.
- Allow for more time. You love seeing progress. But right now your colleagues and loved ones might need more time to get things done. You might need more time. This doesn’t mean you don’t hold yourself and others accountable, you just alter the timeline and necessary supports needed.
- Don’t do it all yourself. Collaboration matters. While you might want to see things getting checked off a to-do list, your influence and long-term goals might be better served by finding ways to collaborate, delegate, and support.
- Ask for feedback. No one has been prepared for all the stress we’re now experiencing, so we all need some perspective. Ask how others are perceiving you today. Listen and thank your respondent(s). Consider their words.
- Look for what you can learn from the [S style](https://www.discprofile.com/what-is-disc/disc-styles/steadiness). For example, consider establishing routines based on what you value. For example, if you value learning, take a regularly scheduled online course. If you value a relationship, schedule regular calls with that person.
- Start a new project. Find one that’s challenging or one that can be finished fairly quickly. Give yourself a sense of accomplishment and progress.
- Try on the [receptive mindset typical of the S style](https://www.discprofiles.com/blog/2020/08/how-to-be-more-receptive/). Stay open to others’ ideas and be willing to compromise.
