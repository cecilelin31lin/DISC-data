Communicating with C-Personalities
When communicating with a C-style individual, focus on facts & details. In this case, minimise pep talk or emotional language. To a high C, the devil is in the details. They are great at following procedures & establishing protocols. They love spreadsheets, data, & information. When communicating with a high C, start with the details. They want to know all the information. If you withhold details, they will likely question your intelligence & trustworthiness. High Cs tend to warm up the slowest. So, be patient with them.

If you continue to provide value through the details they desire, they’ll like you. Don’t try to win a high C over with your charm or personality. Similar to high Ds, High Cs prefer tasks to people. They are more likely to be interested in your skills & competences rather than your personal relationships or hobbies. You should avoid talking about such things until after they feel comfortable with you. High Cs tend to speak in measured, deliberate statements. You know you’ve found a high C if you find them making a big effort to make sure you know exactly what they are trying to say, or find them giving you much more information than you feel is necessary. In summary, be patient, persistent, & diplomatic.
