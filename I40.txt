I – Influence
Those with a high Influence (I) style enjoy collaboration; they are confident, engaging and extremely approachable. These individuals love social settings and value connecting with others; they always look to expand their social circles and enjoy spending time with new people. They get excited to explore fresh ideas and begin new projects and are likely to bounce around between what they are working on. I’s like to multi-task and be involved with lots of things at once.
