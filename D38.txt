Communicating with D-Personalities
When communicating with D-style individuals, give them the bottom line. In this case, be brief & focus your discussion narrowly. Avoid making generalisations. Specifically, refrain from repeating yourself. Most important – focus on solutions rather than problems.
Your D score is your decisiveness. It is your directness. More specifically, it is the speed at which you feel comfortable making decisions you have never had to make before. People with a high D score tend to talk fast, because they think fast.They can’t stand it if you’re not getting right to the point. You can tell if you’ve got a high D because they are likely to interrupt you once they see where you’re going with a conversation. They don’t mean to be rude, it’s just how they think. High Ds love checklists. They love to measure productivity by how much they’ve completed. They also respond great to a challenge. A high D is easily noticeable when they appear irritable if interrupted in the middle of a task.
