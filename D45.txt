High D
Evaluation: Tina emphasizes Dana is excellent at critical thinking, sense-making, and resilience, but is less empathetic. Her communication is sharp and brusque, which has caused issues in working across the organization.
Action: Tina discusses with Dana the importance of empathizing with other employees and being more sociable in her conversations. She also describes how it will affect Dana getting the results she wants and the effect on the new agile approach.
Result: Linking results to simple changes in how she operates was key to Dana altering her behavior. She learned to recognize how negatively some people perceived her interactions, which was not her intention. She could only change this by consciously putting in new ways of writing emails, adjusting non-verbal communication, and making small-talk a habit before getting down to business.
