DiSC Profile- D
People under this category are task-oriented and extremely extroverted. They do not hesitate to make tough calls and are driven in their approach, are certified risk-takers and they demand the same level of commitment from others. They are not short-sighted, hence their prime focus is on the bigger picture. You will find “D” in DiSC Personality Types in top leadership positions of a company or at least in a more authoritarian position.
With such profiling, there is also a presence of a shadow side of every DiSC profile test. When the dominance becomes overbearing, the person becomes impatient to the point of being insensitive. Instead of persuading people to reach a common consensus, they use their authority to reach decisions.
