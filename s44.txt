S – Steadiness
Those with a high Steadiness (S) style tend to be naturally reserved people who look for similarly supportive, consistent, and loyal individuals in their relationships. Many of the S-types’ strengths lie in their patient people-skills; they are known for being sympathetic to others’ perspectives, contributing to the calm, steady environments they help create. This consistent quality makes them excellent in situations that call for diplomatic skills and cooperation.
