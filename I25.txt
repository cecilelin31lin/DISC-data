A vivid example of an I-type personality is Will Smith. He wouldn’t become such a brilliant actor, comedian, producer, rapper, and songwriter if he wasn’t an I-type. He is persuasive, as he believes in every word he says and this belief impacts the people around. He literally infects you with his enthusiasm. His speeches that have turned into numerous videos inspire many people around the world.  The I DiSC type is described as influential, inspirational, interactive, interesting. Clearly, Will Smith ticks all the boxes for an I-type.
