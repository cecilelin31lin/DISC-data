Influence (or I Profile Style)
The Influence is the most outgoing personality. Subsequently, they are the most social among the four personalities. They are enthusiastic, persuasive & are focussed on making connections with others. People with the i style shape their environment by influencing or persuading others. A person with an I style is:
	•	convincing, magnetic, enthusiastic, warm, trusting & optimistic
	•	action-oriented, collaborative, & enthusiastic
	•	motivated by social recognition, group activities, & relationships
	•	values coaching & counseling, freedom of expression & democratic relationships
However, they may limit themselves through their fear of losing their influence & being ignored. Some may perceive their impulsiveness, disorganisation & lack of follow through off-putting.
Communicating with i-Personalities
When communicating with i-style individuals, share your experiences. In this case, allow them time to ask questions & talk themselves. Focus on the positives & avoid overloading them with details. Most important, don’t interrupt them. High i’s love when you are interesting, exciting, & entertaining. If you want a high i to hear what you have to say, you need to capture their attention first. The best way to do this is to make yourself interesting to them. High i’s are people persons, they love people more than tasks. Because their biggest fear is not being liked, be sure to build them up & reassure them they are liked & interesting to you.
Usually, high i’s are extroverted & often have short attention spans.  A high i will bounce from one person at a gathering to another & doesn’t have a problem talking about themselves. You know you’ve found a high i if complimenting them, their clothes, or an aspect of their character causes them to light up & show they like you. High i’s are good at making people feel good, & will want to use their talents to do so.
