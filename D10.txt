Describing the D-style profile type

The D-style profile is the most assertive and demanding of the four DISC types. D-styles tend to be quite competitive and results-oriented. Hence, others see D-styles as being aggressive, blunt, and even rude. When D-styles feel pressured they want to focus even more on getting things done. Therefore, they can come across as insensitive or showing a lack of concern for others. They do not want to lose control. Rather, they want to focus on actively being in charge of tasks and things.
D-styles prefer to move quickly. They are willing to take risks and want to get things done now. They like change and challenges. D-styles can also be impatient and overbearing because they want things done quickly and done their way. They are usually not very good listeners and are prone to make snap decisions. However, they excel at looking at the big picture and multi-tasking. The D-style motto is, “I did it my way”.
They can be limited by their lack of humility, which others may view as arrogance. D-styles like to ask the “what” questions, “What is the bottom line?” or ” What is in it for me?”
